# PRD: Collapsible Sidebar Navigation

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds a responsive, collapsible sidebar navigation to the Covalent Next.js application. The sidebar provides quick access to all main application sections while maximizing screen real estate when collapsed. It enhances user navigation efficiency and maintains a clean, professional interface using shadcn/ui components with custom Covalent theming.

## Goals

1. **Improve Navigation Efficiency**: Provide quick access to all main application sections from any page
2. **Maximize Screen Space**: Allow users to collapse the sidebar to focus on content when needed
3. **Maintain Visual Consistency**: Implement using shadcn/ui components with Covalent's custom brand colors
4. **Ensure Responsive Design**: Adapt sidebar behavior for mobile and desktop experiences
5. **Preserve User Preferences**: Remember sidebar state across browser sessions

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to quickly navigate between different sections of the application so that I can access the tools I need efficiently
- **As a user**, I want to collapse the sidebar when I need more screen space so that I can focus on the main content
- **As a user**, I want the sidebar to remember my preferred state so that I don't have to adjust it every time I visit the application
- **As a mobile user**, I want the sidebar to work as an overlay so that it doesn't interfere with the mobile interface
- **As a user**, I want to clearly see which page I'm currently on so that I can understand my location within the application

## Functional Requirements

1. **Sidebar Structure**: The sidebar must display "Covalent" as a text logo at the top
2. **Navigation Links**: The sidebar must include navigation to Dashboard (/), Deployments (/deployments), Agents (/agents), Tools (/tools), Providers (/providers), Search (/search), and Settings (/settings)
3. **Collapse/Expand Functionality**: The sidebar must have a toggle button aligned to the right that shows a sidebar icon which flips based on the current state
4. **Collapsed State**: When collapsed, the sidebar must show only icons for each navigation item and display "C" instead of "Covalent"
5. **Active Page Highlighting**: The sidebar must visually highlight the currently active page
6. **Responsive Behavior**: On mobile devices (sm breakpoint and below), the sidebar must function as an overlay/drawer
7. **State Persistence**: The sidebar must remember its collapsed/expanded state across browser sessions
8. **Custom Theming**: The application must use custom colors (#1a1429 for background, #c129d8 for primary) and Google Fonts Rubik
9. **Flexible Layout**: When expanded, the sidebar must occupy 1/4 of the screen width
10. **Settings Placement**: Settings must be positioned at the bottom of the sidebar with vertical space above it
11. **Blank Pages Creation**: All navigation destinations must be created as functional but blank pages

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Advanced settings functionality (Settings page will be blank initially)
- User authentication/authorization for navigation items
- Nested navigation or sub-menus
- Dark/light theme toggle (will follow system theme)
- Animation beyond basic expand/collapse transitions
- Search functionality within the sidebar itself

## Design Considerations

- **Component Library**: Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Background: #1a1429
  - Primary: #c129d8
  - Font colors should not be specified unless background is known (e.g., primary buttons with pink background and white text)
- **Typography**: Google Fonts Rubik for all text
- **Icons**: Use appropriate icons for each navigation item (Dashboard, Deployments, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Transform to overlay/drawer on mobile devices using Tailwind's `sm` breakpoint
- **Visual Feedback**: Provide clear hover states and active page indicators

## Technical Considerations

- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Local storage for sidebar state persistence
- **Routing**: Standard Next.js routing with proper page creation
- **Responsive Implementation**: Use Tailwind's responsive utilities
- **Component Structure**: Create reusable sidebar components that can be easily maintained

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Users successfully navigate between all sections without confusion
2. **Performance**: Sidebar state persists correctly across 100% of browser sessions
3. **Responsiveness**: Sidebar functions properly on both desktop and mobile devices
4. **Accessibility**: Sidebar is fully keyboard navigable and screen reader compatible
5. **Visual Consistency**: All shadcn/ui components integrate seamlessly with custom theming

## Open Questions

1. Should the sidebar have keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation?
   No
2. Do we need breadcrumb navigation in addition to the sidebar?
   Not yet, that will be a separate PRD
3. Should there be any onboarding tooltips to explain sidebar functionality?
   No
4. Are there any specific accessibility requirements beyond standard practices?
   No
5. Should the sidebar support drag-and-drop reordering of navigation items in the future?
   No
